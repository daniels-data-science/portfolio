Current version supports only Windows 

Google Takeout allows you to download your watch history for the past three years as a .html file. 
This application will extract its relevant data and presents it cleanly as a .csv file with columns:
'timestamp',
'vid_title',
'vid_link',
'channel_name',
'channel_link'

STEPS:
1. Go to https://takeout.google.com/ and download your YouTube takeout.
2. Unzip your download. There should now be a folder named 'Takeout'.
3. Drag the .exe file to the same directory as the Takeout folder (not inside)
4. Run the .exe
5. Youtube_history.csv will appear in this directory.
6. Note that the .csv is TAB seperated.

Alternatively, the code is also provided.
